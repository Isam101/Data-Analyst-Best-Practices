📊 People Analytics Case Study — Improving Employee Retention

A practical example of applying the 6-step data analysis process to a real business problem.

🔍 Business Problem (Finding the problem we are trying to fix)
A company was facing a high turnover rate among new hires, with many employees leaving within their first year.
The data team was tasked with answering:

“How can we improve the retention rate for new employees?”

They applied the six-step data analysis process: Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act.

1️⃣ ASK — Define the Problem & Questions

The analysts clarified the goals and gathered context by asking leaders:
What do new employees need to succeed in year one?
Do you have historical data we can review?
Why do you think some teams retain better than others?
What causes dissatisfaction for new employees?
What retention improvement percentage is expected?

🔑 Outcome: A clear project scope + a measurable success target.

2️⃣ PREPARE — Plan the Data Collection

The team built a 3-month timeline and designed an online survey for new employees.
(Method) 
They planned:
Survey questions on satisfaction, onboarding, hiring, compensation
Data access rules (only aggregated data visible outside the team)
How results should be visualized

Potential risks + how to avoid them

🔑 Outcome: A structured plan for ethical and effective data collection.

3️⃣ PROCESS — Clean, Protect & Store the Data

To maintain confidentiality and trust, analysts:
Restricted raw data access to a small group
Cleaned and validated responses
Aggregated sensitive fields (e.g., compensation ranges)
Uploaded raw data to a secure internal warehouse

🔑 Outcome: Clean, secure, and usable survey data.

4️⃣ ANALYZE — Identify Key Insights

The analysis uncovered two major findings:
🚩 Negative Predictor:
Employees who experienced a long, complicated hiring process were more likely to leave early.

⭐ Positive Predictor:
Employees with a transparent and efficient evaluation + feedback process were more likely to stay long-term.

🔑 Outcome: Concrete factors linked to satisfaction and retention.

5️⃣ SHARE — Communicate Results Effectively
To ensure proper context and trust:
Results were shared only with managers who met response minimums
Analysts presented findings directly to managers
Managers delivered results to their teams to spark conversations

🔑 Outcome: Managers understood the findings and could discuss them meaningfully with employees.

6️⃣ ACT — Implement Solutions
Based on insights, the team recommended:
Standardizing the hiring process
Standardizing evaluation/feedback procedures
Running the same survey annually for comparison
One year later, survey results confirmed retention significantly improved.

🔑 Outcome: Data-driven actions produced measurable business impact.

📘 Key Takeaways

People analytics uses data to improve workplace culture and employee experience.
The 6-step analysis process works for ANY business problem.
Ethical data practices build trust and enable honest responses.
Real impact comes from actionable insights + good communication.
Even simple surveys can reveal patterns that save companies money and reduce turnover.

💡 Why This Matters (My Reflection)

This case study shows how data analytics isn’t just about numbers it’s about:
1) understanding people
2) solving real business problems
3) improving processes
4) creating better workplaces
5) influencing leadership decisions

It demonstrates exactly how the skills I am learning in the Google Data Analytics Certificate translate into real organizational impact.
