This section introduces SQL and how it’s used to communicate with databases. A query is simply a request for data, written using SQL syntax. Every SQL query is built using three core clauses:

SELECT – choose the columns

FROM – choose the table

WHERE – filter the results

The guide explains how to write simple queries, select multiple columns, and combine multiple conditions using operators like AND, OR, and NOT. 
Examples show how SQL retrieves specific data (e.g., customers named Tony) and how adding conditions refines results. These fundamentals form the foundation for writing more advanced SQL queries later.
