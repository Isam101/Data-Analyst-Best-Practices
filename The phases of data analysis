📘 Summary: The Phases of the Data Analysis Process

The data analysis process has six phases:
Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act
Each step builds on the last to turn raw data into meaningful decisions.

1️⃣ Ask Phase

The foundation of the entire analysis.
Analysts must:
Understand stakeholder expectations
Define the problem
Create clear, focused questions

This phase ensures the analyst knows what is needed, why, and how the results will be used.

2️⃣ Prepare Phase

The goal is to find the right data. Analysts:
Identify sources
Decide what data is useful
Ensure data is unbiased and objective
Good analysis starts with the right data, not just any data.

3️⃣ Process Phase

This phase cleans and improves the data so it’s ready to analyze. Analysts:
Clean errors
Reformat or transform data
Combine datasets
Remove outliers
They also verify that cleaned data is correct, complete, and trustworthy.

4️⃣ Analyze Phase

Now the cleaned data becomes insightful information. Analysts:
Look for trends, relationships, and patterns
Use tools like spreadsheets, SQL, and R
Answer the questions defined in the Ask phase
This is where the real decision-making value begins.

5️⃣ Share Phase

Analysts communicate insights to stakeholders using:
Data stories
Visualizations
Dashboards
Reports
Clear communication helps stakeholders understand the results and make data-driven decisions.

6️⃣ Act Phase

The final step: put insights into action.
In this program, the "act" phase is:
Completing a case study
Adding it to your portfolio
Preparing for the job search
This is where everything you learn becomes practical and valuable.
