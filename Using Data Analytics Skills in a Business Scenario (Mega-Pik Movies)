Mega-Pik International is struggling: five of their last six movies barely broke even, and one lost money.
They noticed competitors recovered by creating remakes, so they want to use *exploratory data analysis (EDA)*  to understand what audiences like and what makes a movie successful.

Your team identifies three main EDA goals:
1) Find key factors that drive opening-weekend success
2) Understand the relationship between budget and revenue
3) Identify which genres perform best

A dataset is prepared with details like revenue, rating, genre, release date, budget, and marketing cost.

🔎 How the Five Data Analyst Skills Apply
1. Curiosity
Data analysts ask questions that lead to insights.
Examples:
Does a higher budget lead to higher revenue?
Which genres perform best in each season?
Should we include more data like demographic info?
Curiosity helps analysts uncover patterns and opportunities.

2. Understanding Context

Context explains why the data behaves the way it does.
Examples:
Family movies earn more when kids are on school break.
Holidays, competition, and global release timing affect performance.
Revenue must be analyzed across multiple years to avoid seasonal bias.
Context makes analysis meaningful and prevents false conclusions.

3. Technical Mindset

A technical mindset means breaking problems into logical parts:
Cleaning and preparing the dataset
Choosing appropriate tools
Finding and correcting inaccurate or missing data
This mindset helps analysts systematically work through complex problems.

4. Data Design

Data design is how you structure and organize information.
Example:
Sorting by revenue then genre might reveal comedy performs better than drama.
Good data design makes analysis easier and far more insightful.

5. Data Strategy

Data strategy is how you manage the people, processes, and tools in analysis:
Choosing Excel/Sheets for simple dashboards
Using Tableau if data updates automatically
Prioritizing analyses that impact next quarter’s revenue first
Good strategy allocates resources effectively and leads to actionable results.

⭐ Key Takeaways

Analysts naturally use curiosity, context, technical thinking, data design, and data strategy to solve business problems.
These skills become powerful when paired with proper tools, processes, and structured analysis.
Understanding how to apply these skills in real business scenarios—like helping Mega-Pik make better movie decisions—is essential for becoming a strong data analyst.
