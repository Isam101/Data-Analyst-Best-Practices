Different stages of the data analysis process require different tools.
Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) are great for organizing, cleaning, and analyzing small or medium datasets.
Databases + SQL are better for large, complex datasets because they store data efficiently, enforce strict structure, allow multiple users, and retrieve information quickly.

Data analysts often use both together—for example, pulling data from a database into a spreadsheet for analysis, or moving spreadsheet data into a database when it grows too large.
Programming languages like R and Python offer even more control for analysis and visualization.

Key takeaway:
Use spreadsheets for lighter, hands-on analysis; use databases for large, structured, multi-user data; and combine tools when necessary to get the best results.
